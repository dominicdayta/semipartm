# semipartm

The following is the code repository for the paper "Semiparametric Latent Topic Modelling on Consumer Generated Corpora" co-authored by myself and Prof. Erniel Barrios, Ph. D.

The primary codes for performing the operations can be found in the `./Source` directory. These are used by the script `test-sptm.R` to create a general function that trains and evaluates a SemiparTM model.
